	  using a timer and stores results in a buffer accessible
	  to the application.

	help
	  Frequency at which ADC channels are sampled using DMA.
	  Higher frequencies provide better resolution for fast-changing
	  signals but increase CPU/DMA load.
	  Default: 10 kHz (10000 Hz)

config FOC_ADC_NUM_CHANNELS

	help
	  Number of ADC channels to sample via DMA.
	  Must match the number of channels configured in device tree.
